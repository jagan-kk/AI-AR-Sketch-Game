# AI-AR-Sketch-Game
The application allows users to draw simple objects on paper. A custom-trained AI model then recognizes the sketch in real-time( maze, grid, square). Once identified, the drawing is transformed into a 2D game platform and rendered into the user's environment through their device's camera, creating a seamless and magical gaming experience.
